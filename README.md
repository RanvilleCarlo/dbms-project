## Introduction

This project is a Delivery Website built as a part of a Database Management System (DBMS) course. The website serves as a platform for users to browse and order products that are created by various machines. It also includes features for inventory management and user authentication.

## Features

- **Product Display:** The website displays available products with details such as product name, description, price, and stock quantity.

- **Order Process:** Users can add products to their cart, view the cart, and place orders.

- **Inventory Management:** Administrators can add new products to the inventory, update product details, and manage stock quantities.

- **User Authentication:** User registration and login functionality are implemented, allowing users to have personalized accounts.

- **Database Integration:** The project utilizes a relational database to store product information, orders, inventory data, and user profiles.

- **Payment Processing:** Future implementation can include payment processing for online orders.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- Backend: Server-side scripting (e.g., Node.js with Express.js, Django, or another framework)
- Database: Relational Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- User Authentication: Sessions, JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Deployment: Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), domain hosting

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up the backend server using a web framework of your choice (e.g., Node.js with Express.js, Django).

3. Set up the database and import the provided schema.

4. Update the database configuration in the backend code to connect to your database.

5. Install any necessary dependencies by running `npm install` (for Node.js) or `pip install` (for Django).

## Usage

1. Start the backend server.

2. Access the website through your web browser.

3. Register as a new user or log in if you already have an account.

4. Browse available products, add them to your cart, and place orders.

5. Admins can access the inventory management features and add/update products.

## Database Schema

## Frontend Implementation

- The frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly design.

- JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website.

- The website includes multiple pages for different features like product display, cart management, inventory, and user authentication.

## Backend Implementation

- The backend is implemented using a web framework (e.g., Node.js with Express.js, Django).

- It handles database operations, user authentication, and order processing.

- The backend communicates with the frontend using API endpoints.

## Deployment

- Deploy the website on a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

- Configure the server to host the frontend and backend files.

- Set up a domain name for the website.
